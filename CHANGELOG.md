## [v0.2.0] - 2022-05-23

Breaking change: Mojito library was deprecated, so we removed first class
support for it. This will effect your dependencies.

We have decided to use the [Req](https://hex.pm/packages/req) as it is built on
top of Finch and allows us to keep the default API simple.

To upgrade you will need to remove `:mojito` from you dependencies are replace
it with `{:req, "~> 0.2.2}`, if you are using the default HTTP client that
`InfluxEx` uses. If you're using a custom HTT client you can ignore this and
safely update.

### Changed

- Removed support for Mojito HTTP library
- The `InfluxEx.HTTP.Req` client is the default client used by InfluxEx

### Added

- `InfluxEx.HTTP.Req` client

### Removed

- `InfluxEx.HTTP.Mojito`

## [v0.1.1] - 2022-05-19

### Fixed

- `Influx.Flux.run_query/2` add query opts to type spec
- `InfluxEx.Flux.run_query/2` wrong return error type in spec

## v0.1.0 - 2022-05-12
